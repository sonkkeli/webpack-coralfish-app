This repo is my development environment for developing the
`webbundle-webpack-plugin`, `rollup-plugin-webbundle`, `wbn` and `wbn-sign` npm
packages.

It has a very simple web app which is converted into a web bundle having local
versions of all the above mentioned npm packages.

If you want to use it, just fork all the above mentioned npm packages and this
and then for this repo run any of the scripts `npm run run:webpack`,
`npm run run:rollup` or `npm run run:cli`.

Be sure to use Node version 14+.
