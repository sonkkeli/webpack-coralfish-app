This repo is my messy development environment for developing
`webbundle-webpack-plugin`, `rollup-plugin-webbundle`, `wbn` and `wbn-sign` npm
packages.

It has a very simple web app which is converted into a web bundle with locally
built versions of all the above mentioned npm packages.

If you want to use it, just fork and clone `WICG/webpackage` and
`GoogleChromeLabs/webbundle-plugins` npm packages and this into the same root
directory and then for this repo run any of the scripts on `package.json`
e.g. `npm run run:webpack`.

Minimum version requirements are `Node` 14+ and `npm` 8+.
